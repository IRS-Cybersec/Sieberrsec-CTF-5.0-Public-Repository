Flag: `sctf{nami_island}`

## Description:
Hmph! My friend won't tell me where she went for her trip! All I know is that she likes to post her travel pictures on her social media account 'CeliLataGusha' . Can you find out what is the name of the place she went?

The location may have alternate names so use the English one. Wrap the flag in 'sctf{location_name}' and submit it in lowercase.

## Hint: 
Have you heard of HoyoLab?


## Solution:
1. Searching CeliLataGusha will show a reference to Small Lamp Grass from Genshin Impact
2. Since it is related to Genshin Impact, there is a social media platform related to Genshin Impact called HoyoLab that also comes out in search results
3. Search for CeliLataGusha in HoyoLab users and you will find the account
4. Scroll through the posts until the middle one where the photo posted is not from Genshin Impact and is an actual photo taken
5. From the bottom left corner of the photo, you can see some Korean words on the blue train so you can guess that the place is in Korea (most probably South Korea)
6. On the bottom right, there are some flags and greetings that look unique. Crop out that part of the picture and upload it to Google Lens
7. A lot of similar images will come out, tap any one and they will usually link it to Nami Island
