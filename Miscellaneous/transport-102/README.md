Flag: `sctf{36_16}`

## Description
I am lost again! Here's a picture of where I am now and my destination is Bus Stop 95151. Which bus should I take and how many stops away is it?

Wrap the flag in sctf{busNumber_NumOfStops}

## Solution

1. Using lamp post 19, there is a website by STB to show that lamp post 19 is beside Bencoolen MRT Exit B
2. Searching Bus Stop 95151 will give Airport Police Station
3. By comparing the bus services to both bus stops, only bus service 36 goes to both
4. Using SMRT Journey website or other websites, counting the number of bus stops to go from Bencoolen MRT Exit B to Airport Police Station is 16 stops
