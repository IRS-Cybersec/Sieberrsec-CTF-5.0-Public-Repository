## Solution

1. Use a text reverser to reverse the challenge description
2. Reverse the binary file using tools like CyberChef or a script(python script solve1 in sol folder)
3. The challenge description hints that it is a python file, save it the reversed file as a .pyc file
4. Use decompyle3 to decompile the pyc file and write it to a python file
5. Reverse engineer the simple encryption algorithm (python script solve2 in sol folder) using the hex in output.txt as the encrypted text
