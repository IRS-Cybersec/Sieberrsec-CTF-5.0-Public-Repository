# Square Keys

*Creator - Iri*

## Description

Can you help me make a pair of square keys?

## Hints

1. How can the condition be expressed nicely in the form of an equation?

## Solution
Solution to this challenge:
1. Using Vieta jumping, we can find new solutions ``x1 = (x-y+((x-y)^2-4*a)/(x+y))/2 and y1 = (x-y-((x-y)^2-4*a)/(x+y))/2``
2. Hence, this directly finds the x we need to ensure that y^2 is a perfect square.
