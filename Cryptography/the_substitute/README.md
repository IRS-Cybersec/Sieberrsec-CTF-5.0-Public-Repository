# The Substitute

*Creator - landen*

## Description
Mr Fox, our cryptanalyst and typist, called in sick today, so we had to bring in a substitute. However, when he was making the cipher, he was too lazy to copy down the key!!! Can you decode the cipher. (Wrap flag in sctf{})

ciphertext: ZXZZKTVTWTGDQXC


## Solution
Solution to this challenge
1. Google 'Fox', 'typist', and 'lazy' to get the popular sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
2. from 'substitute' you should be able to gather that this is a substitution cipher
3. Decode the substitution cipher with 'THEQUICKBROWNFXJMPSVLAZYDG' (removed repeat characters) as the key.
