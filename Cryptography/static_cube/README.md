# Static Cube

*Creator - Iri*

## Description

I'm tired of people breaking my RSA when e = 3 using CRT! I'm just going to give you the output, no way am I letting you get multiple moduli!

## Hints
1. What ways are there to attack RSA when e is small?

## Solution
Solution to this challenge:
1. Use Coppersmith's attack, and you can find the answer.

## Flag

SCTF{d1d_y0u_u5e_c0pp3r5mi7h_a77ack_490a80dc0e0bf33}
